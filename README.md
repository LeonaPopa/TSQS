# **Text Style Query System**

### **Overview**
The **Text Style Query System** is an AI-powered educational tool that helps students improve their academic writing and learn more effectively. The system offers personalized feedback by analyzing students' writing styles and answering questions based on their preferred learning methods. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to handle queries and compares users' writing against a Ground Truth (GT) database of academic standards.
